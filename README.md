# hospital Web Page


I developed this hospital website myself while I was thinking of ways to alleviate hospital-related stress and streamline appointment booking. Although there are already several similar applications developed by other programmers, I undertook this project as an opportunity to enhance my skills and establish myself in the field. One day, I sat down and contemplated what more I could create to make a meaningful contribution.
